Q: What is a javascript REPL? Can you name two ways to open one?

A: {A JavaScript REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.

It's a simple, interactive programming environment that lets you type in JavaScript commands one at a time.

REPLs are incredibly useful for testing small code snippets, debugging logic, or learning the language without needing to create and run a whole file.

And the most common ways to access a JavaScript REPL:

1. The Browser Console - This is built right into your web browser (like Chrome or Edge). 
2. Node.js Terminal If you have Node.js (a JavaScript runtime for servers and computers) installed, you can use its built-in REPL.}
